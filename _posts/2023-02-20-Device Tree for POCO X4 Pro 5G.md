# Project-Xtended
Released my first build. let clear some basics.

# Device Tree
The Device Tree (DT) is a hierarchical configuration data format that describes the hardware components of a device. Each device is assigned a Device Tree blob (DTB) that describes the hardware components of the device.
The Device Tree is the foundation of the Device Tree Overlay (DTO) technology. DTO lets you add hardware components to a device without changing the core kernel.

The primary purpose of Device Tree in Linux is to provide a way to describe non-discoverable hardware. This information was previously hard coded in source code.

Some more background on what Device Tree is, advantages, and competing solutions, see this page. Most of the contents of this page was previously located at Device_Tree, which now redirects to Device_Tree_Reference.
