# Computational Methods
Computational methods are computer-based methods used to numerically solve mathematical models that describe physical phenomena. The purpose of computational modeling is to study the behavior of complex systems by means of computer simulations and it can be used to make predictions of the system's behavior under different conditions, often for cases in which intuitive analytical solutions are not available (Nature, 2018). Computational methods have emerged in engineering during the 1960s. Since then, structural engineers have been leaders in technological solutions to engineering analysis and design problems. The evolution of electronic computers together with the tremendous increase of computational power has triggered the continuous development of computational methods. Rapid advances in computer hardware have had a profound effect on various engineering disciplines. The applications are numerous and cover a broad field of engineering branches including civil, mechanical, naval, electrical, aerospace, material, biomolecular, among others. Computational structural engineering has evolved as an insightful blend combining both structural analysis and computer science.

# Data Structures
Data structures are collections of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. Data structures are important tools in programming because they define the organization of data, organize the data, and define the functions that can be applied
to the data. Data structures are important because they define the organization of data, organize the data, and define the functions that can be applied to the data.

# C language
C is a general-purpose programming language. It is a compiled programming language with a static type system and dynamic binding. C is a compiled language in the sense that it compiles the program to machine code before execution. C is a compiled language in the sense that
it compiles the program to machine code before execution. C is a compiled language in the sense that it compiles the program to machine code before execution. C is a compiled language in the sense that it compiles the program to machine code before execution.

# Scilab
Scilab is a free and open-source numerical computing software that provides a powerful computing environment for engineering and scientific applications. It includes a high-level programming language, a large number of built-in mathematical functions, and tools for data visualization and analysis. Scilab is similar to Matlab in functionality, and it can perform a vast range of numerical computations, such as linear algebra, statistics, optimization, signal processing, and modeling, among others. It provides an easy-to-use interface for users, and its syntax is easy to learn and understand. Scilab is available on different platforms, including Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.

# DBMS

DBMS stands for Database Management System. It is a software that is used to manage and organize data in a structured manner. DBMS offers an interface between the user and the database. It allows users to perform various operations such as creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving data from a database.

Some of the key features of DBMS include:
1. Data Security: DBMS provides various security mechanisms to ensure that data is secured and accessed by authorized users only. This includes user authentication, data encryption, and access control.
2. Data Consistency: DBMS ensures that data is consistent by providing mechanisms such as transaction management and concurrency control.
3. Data Integrity: DBMS ensures that the data stored in the database is accurate and consistent by providing mechanisms such as data validation and referential integrity.
4. Data Backup and Recovery: DBMS provides mechanisms to backup and restore data to ensure that data is not lost in case of system failures.
5. Query Language: DBMS provides a query language that allows users to retrieve data from the database. SQL (Structured Query Language) is the most popular query language used by DBMS.
Some popular DBMS systems include Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.
